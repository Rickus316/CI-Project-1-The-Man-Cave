# CI-Project-1-The-Man-Cave
My First Coding project - "The Man Cave" Mental Heath Awareness for Men!

Introduction:

"The Man Cave" Mental Health Awareness for men is a website that aims at addressing men's mental health issues in a supportive and organised way providing a safe, non-judemental and private space to help men who are going through a tough time. Dealing with Mental Health is tough, believe me I know. Our aim is to break the stigma that men shouldn't suffer from Mental Health just because we are men! We want to build a Brotherhood for men from all walks of life.

It's aim is to help users:
Recognise the most common mental health issues men face.
Provide helpful ways for men to manage stress, whether that be resources or self-help tools.
Provide a safe non-judgemental and private space to help support men who are going through a tough time.

The aim for the site owner are:
Create a welcoming webpage with an easy-to-use and organised layout.
The webpage needed to provide basic mental health information.
Use a clear and supportive design.
Focusing on the use of HTML and CSS with Bootstrap/ Flexbox and AI providing addition tools to create a calming and well-organised user experience.

Here is the full project remit:

Features: This is what potentially could be added to the project

A "Hero Section" with positive and encouraging message about mental health.
Using a calm colour scheme and simple images.
Information cards using Bootstraps card components to present common mental health issues for men and mental health tips.
Make the content of the webpage visulally appealing and ensure it is organised.
Resource Links, provide a grid layout for external links to mental health resources styled with bootstrap to make them stand out (to be added).
Positive Affirmations, using Bootstrap's text utilities to include a section with uplifting quotes or messages to encourage users (to be added).

Planning Stage:

Step 1: This was to figure out the webpages purpose and the "User Stories"

Webpage Purpose:

User Stories:

Step 1 - conclusions:

Step 2 - Design Decisions:

Font:

Color Scheme - I chose the main color to be Green as a green ribbon is used for mental health:

Potential icons:

Potential Images (I did consider using AI for these but I didn't like the idea in the end). Also, because I had to scale back my ideas (Oops!) I wasn't able to incorporate all these images BUT I will if I continue to work on this webpage myself.

Step 3 - Wireframes (using Balsamiq): Please note I found myself making the scope bigger when using the "Wireframes" and had to cut it back :) so I used a combination of the Wireframes provided by Code Institute, the walkthrough project "Boardwalk Games", AI (Git Copilot and Microsoft Copilot), https://www.themancaveuk.co.uk/ and The Man Cave Facebook group I'm part of to bring my webpage together.

Step 4: Documentation (README) - Due to time and this being my first ever coding project I used the README Essential supplied by Code Institute and Microsoft AI Copilot to shape this.

Step 5 - Get to Coding: Be brave, be bold and most of all BE YOU!!

Here are a bunch of "Future Additions" (In no particular order) that I'd like to add in the future.
