My First Coding project - "The Man Cave" Mental Heath Awareness for Men!

Introduction:

"The Man Cave" Mental Health Awareness for men is a website that aims at addressing men's mental health issues in a supportive and organised way providing a safe, non-judemental and private space to help men who are going through a tough time. Dealing with Mental Health is tough, believe me I know. Our aim is to break the stigma that men shouldn't suffer from Mental Health just because we are men! We want to build a Brotherhood for men from all walks of life.

It's aim is to help users:
Recognise the most common mental health issues men face.
Provide helpful ways for men to manage stress, whether that be resources or self-help tools.
Provide a safe non-judgemental and private space to help support men who are going through a tough time.

The aim for the site owner are:
Create a welcoming webpage with an easy-to-use and organised layout.
The webpage needed to provide basic mental health information.
Use a clear and supportive design.
Focusing on the use of HTML and CSS with Bootstrap/ Flexbox and AI providing addition tools to create a calming and well-organised user experience.
